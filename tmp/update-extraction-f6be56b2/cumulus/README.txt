/**
 * Cumulus for Drupal
 * README.txt
 */

Cumulus is a module that provides a beautiful, Flash-based 3D tag cloud implementation.
It is based on Roy Tanck's WordPress module called WP-Cumulus (see http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cumulus/)


/**
 * Installing (VERY IMPORTANT!)
 */

- After you put Cumulus in your sites/all/modules or sites/default/modules (or where ever you put them :-) you need swfobject v1.x
- This library can't be put on drupal.org since its not licensed under GPL v2.
- Get that file from one of the following locations
  http://pratul.in/files/cumulus.js
  http://pratulkalia.googlepages.com/cumulus.js
  http://google-ajax-examples.googlecode.com/svn-history/r44/trunk/scripts/swfobject-1.5.js
- Rename it to cumulus.js
- Put it in your Cumulus folder.
- That's it!
